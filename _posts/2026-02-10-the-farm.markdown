This work explores a daydream that I believe serves as an escape for many people during their most mundane days. The dream of settling in a palce of peace and safety, away from the noise that is our current and cluttered world. The composition is structured through a first-person perspective, looking out of a cottage window onto endless greenery. My intention was to flood the sky and windows with light, to create the warm feeling of a bright spring morning.
