At the start of the new year of 2023, I became fascinated with the imagery and symbolism of skeletons. I was inspired, specifically, to incorporate skeletons in juxtapositions with less commonly associated themes such as hope, joy, and change. This piece entitled “Breaking Free” was the result of considering that the idea of “running out time” in the context of meeting goals or expectations we place upon ourselves, was suffocating. When this imaginary timeline I made for myself was shattered I felt liberated and alive once more.
