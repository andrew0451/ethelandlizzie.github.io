This work is a recreation of my favorite human’s eyes. It is, however, not only an anatomical replication, but a playful expression of the love that blooms within me every time he looks at me. When our eyes meet it is not just an exchange of glances but a feeling of being understood and fully seen from the inside out without any need for words between either of us.
