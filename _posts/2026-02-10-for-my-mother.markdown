This piece explores legacy, and the unseen threads it weaves from generation to generation. The poem integrated into the movement and flow of the piece was written by my grandmother after she lost her husband and was paralyzed by the tragic tornado that hit Lubbock in 1970. In her later years and throughout my childhood she lived with my family, my mother being her primary keeper until her passing. Through tragedy and hardship both my grandmother and mother still managed to instill grit, wisdom, and character amongst the children and grandchildren. Right before my grandmother passed, she told us that all the women in the room had crowns on our heads. The strength and courage of mothers have defined my family’s legacy long before me. Their resilience has borne fruits of joy that now live through me.
