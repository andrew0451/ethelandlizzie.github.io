This piece was created alongside my students while working on a project in which they were encouraged to explore the idea of identity by designing a mask that represented who they were. For middle schoolers, this can be a complicated and confusing idea, so I made an example to guide them through the process. In doing so I was quite pleased with how fulfilling and therapeutic this was. I started by taking 10 minutes to “brain dump” any words, numbers, or symbols that represented me on a blank piece of paper. I then tore this paper into smaller pieces to collage on to my mask. In addition to this primary collaging material, I also incorporated other symbols and imagery that I felt were representative of my own identity such as butterflies and flowers to symbolize change and growth.
